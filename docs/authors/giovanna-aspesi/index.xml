&lt;h1 id=&#34;minutes&#34;&gt;Minutes&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Indian Land Republican Women club met for our second official charter meeting at Midtown Sundries on Thursday,
September 13th. President, Michelle Simonetti called the meeting to order at 7:07pm. Claire McConaughay led with invocation
then Vice President Beverly Williams led with the Pledge of Allegiance. Nancy Connor gave a treasurer report balance of
$339.64, some funds were used for office supplies and renting a booth at the Fall Festival. Change in secretary was announced,
Giovanna Aspesi will be the new secretary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introductions of all present began. Attendees found out about meeting from friends, Gateway Ad and Facebook. Our goal is to
network in the community and get some female republican candidates.
Announcement: We will need volunteers for our Fall Festival booth. A sign up sheet was passed around.
New Business: Guest Speakers tonight will be Candidate Probate Judge Dee Studebaker, House Representative Brandon
Newton, Lauren Thomas “Be in Favor” about the upcoming Rec Bond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dee Studebaker is running for a four year term of Probate Judge. She is Lancaster County Associate Probate Judge. She is an
attorney with 24 years of experience. She lives in Indian Land with her husband and two sons. She explained to us that a
probate judge deals with estates, guardianship of children, as well as, mental illness detention orders. She asked for our support
in November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brandon Newton is our current District 45 House Representative and is running for re-election. He discussed
some accomplishments from this last session: HOA reform, more money for education and roads. Hoping to work on pension
reform next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lauren Thomas spoke to us about the upcoming rec bond. The county is currently spending $13 per person on recreation. We
have around 93,000 people in the Lancaster area. Compared to other areas this is very low. Bond would allow for updates to be
made at the Indian Land recreation center, development of land on Harrisburg Road into 2 fields with artificial turf and
parking/concession area. Kershaw/Health Springs will get a field with artificial turf and Lindsey Pettus Greenway Auditorium will
be updated. If bond is passed cost to taxpayers will be $16 per 100,000 of home value. Maintenance cost would have to be
covered by county.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Members were reminded that the next ILRW meeting will be on Monday October 8th at 7:00 PM, not Oct 11th as Sun City
Republican club will be joining us to host November candidates. Location is Rebound Behavioral Health 134 E Rebound Rd,
Lancaster SC. Guest speakers will be Congressman Ralph Norman, Attorney General Alan Wilson, County School Board
candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meeting was adjourned at 8:27pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Respectfully submitted by Giovanna Aspesi&lt;/p&gt;
